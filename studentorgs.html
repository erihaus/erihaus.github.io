      <h2 id="catalog-milestone-1-">Catalog</h2>
      <h3 id="describe-your-catalog-milestone-1-">Describe your Catalog </h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What will your collection be about? What types of attributes will you keep track of for the <em>things</em>
          in
          your catalog? 1-2 sentences.
          My collection will be a catalog for professional or career-related clubs and student organizations at Cornell.
          I
          will keep track of the name of each club or student organization, the type of career the club is related to,
          its
          mission, and website link.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id="target-audience-s-milestone-1-">Target Audience(s)</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Tell us about your target audience(s).
          My target audiences will be students who are interested in joining a new club on campus and the members of
          clubs
          who want their club to be included on my catalog. It&#39;s important that the catalog isn&#39;t overwhelming
          and
          doesn&#39;t discourage students from wanting to join a club. Additionally, it&#39;s important that club
          members
          feel that their website is accurately and fully represented on my catalog.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id="design-patterns-milestone-1-">Design Patterns</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Review some existing catalog that are similar to yours. List the catalog&#39;s you reviewed here. Write a
          small
          reflection on how you might use the design patterns you identified in your review in your own catalog.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://cornell.campusgroups.com/club_signup" title="Cornell CampusGroups Catalog">Cornell
              CampusGroups</a></li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I will include the search bar and categories the user can filter by at the top of the page like Cornell
        CampusGroups did. Then, the search bar will be the first thing the user sees. This is important because most
        users
        will probably want to use the filter or search functionality instead of searching through the entire list of
        clubs.
        They will want to filter the clubs to only see the clubs related to their major or career path. Instead of just
        displaying the URL, each club also has a button for their website so the user can easily visit it. The user must
        click on the name of the club to be directed to a page with more information about it. This is a better
        alternative
        to displaying the description of every club in the catalog, which would look crowded and dense.</p>
      <h2 id="design-planning-milestone-2-">Design &amp; Planning</h2>
      <h2 id="design-process-milestone-2-">Design Process</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Document your design process. Show us the evolution of your design from your first idea (sketch) to design
          you
          wish to implement (sketch). Show us the process you used to organize content and plan the navigation, if
          applicable.
          Label all images. All labels must be visible in VS Code&#39;s Markdown Preview.
          Clearly label the final design.
          <img src="images/first.jpg" alt="First Design Sketch">
          First Design Sketch. Filters are below the search. I put the search bar at the top so the user knows it exists
          and
          understands that they should use it. I made sure to list the name of the club first before any other
          information.
          I included the title of the website on the navigation bar and an option to move the home page or an about
          page.
          I
          decided not to add an about page because the website is self-explanatory.
          <img src="images/second.jpeg" alt="Second sketch on left and final on right">
          Second sketch on the left and final sketch on the right. Decided to change filters into dropdown menus and
          changed
          placement of
          dropdown menus to be next to the search bar because most users will use filters when searching. Decided to use
          icons to show the values
          instead of text only to make it more legible.</p>

      <h1 id="reflection-final-submission-">Reflection (Final Submission)</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Take this time to reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved since Project 1?
          What
          things did you have trouble with?
          I have improved in considering the usability of an interface, how to prioritze information that the user wants
          through design, and
          how to think of the information users want most. I had trouble with resisting the urge to just erase parts of
          my
          design while drawing it. Instead, I should finish a full iteration of the design and make changes in the next
          iteration to show my progress and also test every idea I have and see how it looks before eliminating it as an
          option.</p>
